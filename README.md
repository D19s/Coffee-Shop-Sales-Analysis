# Coffee_Shop_Sales_Analysis



**Overview:**

The project's purpose is to visually represent the sales performance of a coffee shop spanning from January 2023 to May 2023. It will provide insights into important metrics, including total sales, total orders, total quantity sold, and detailed breakdowns by dimensions such as day, product category, product type, store location, weekday versus weekend sales, and sales by hour. This dashboard was created using advanced DAX functions and confirmed with complex SQL queries to ensure accurate data analysis and reporting.

**Objectives:**

The primary aim of this dashboard is to address three main KPIs: Total Sales Analysis, Total Orders Analysis, and Total Quantity Sold Analysis. The objective is to recognise sales trends, comprehend customer purchasing behaviours, and highlight the best-performing products and locations. The insights obtained from this dashboard can aid in strategic decision-making to optimise sales and enhance overall business performance.

**Methodology:**

1. Acquire sales data from Jan 2023 to May 2023, incorporating transaction details, product information, store locations, and timestamps. The dataset encompasses 0.15 million records over six months from three coffee shops.
2. Dashboard Development:
	Design: Develop a Power BI dashboard using advanced DAX functions and tooltips to extract insights and ensure interactivity. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total orders, and total quantity sold are highlighted with three sub-KPIs each.
	SQL Validation: Carry out advanced SQL queries, including window functions, date operations, subqueries, and joins, to validate the dashboard findings and ensure precise data analysis and reporting consistency.
3. Undertake thorough exploratory analysis to reveal correlations and trends and obtain insights from the KPIs and chart requirements.

**Insights:**

1. On average, there was a 13% increase in month-on-month sales.
2. The difference between weekend and weekday sales is $1-2k, indicating that the store caters to corporate and non-corporate customers.
3. Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, and Hot Chocolate consistently rank as the top 3 best-selling products throughout the month and day.
4. Considering the drop in sales during the afternoon, introducing a lunch deal and evening light snack option could be beneficial.
5. Sales are higher than average in the mid-week of the month and lower during other weeks. Loyalty cards could help boost sales during these periods.
